# Data processing

This file is a backup of our work to generate our Neo4j database. 

There are several scripts, for example 'UploadDatabase.py', which was used to upload the Neo4j database from a csv we had downloaded from the OpenStreetMap site.

There is also another file 'OpenStreetMap_API_Connection.py' which was a connection test file required in our process. 

Finally, there is a 'Credentials' file which retrieves our database logs. This file is also present in the backend folder because we use the connection to the Neo4j database to send it read requests.
